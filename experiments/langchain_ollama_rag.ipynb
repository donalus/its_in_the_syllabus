Technology and architectures will be discussed within the contexts of solving social issues, supportingscience, and conducting business operations. Current computing topics such as web environments, IoT, security, management, and policy will also be reviewed.\\n\\nCourse Objectives\\n\\nAfter successfully completing this course, you will be able to:\\n- Articulate major hardware, software and networking concepts and components that comprise current digital information infrastructure.\\n- Evaluate hardware, software, and network solutions for organizational needs.\\n- Identify emerging threats to information security and develop effective approaches to addressing those threats.\\n- Construct an infrastructure and architecture proposal to solve a real-world problem related to solving social issues, supporting science, or conducting business operations.\\n- Explain how technical systems are situated in and reflect broader social and organizational\\nstructures, and the ethical and equity issues this entails.\\n\\nCourse Materials\\n\\nRequired Textbook: James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross. 2020. Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (8th Edition) (8th. ed.). Pearson.\\n\\nCourse Structure\\n\\nThis course is organized into 12 modules, each of which will be covered in a week. Each module will consist of a combination of readings, videos, and hands-on activities. The course will be delivered in a hybrid format, with both in-person and online components. In-person sessions will be held on Thursdays from 10:00-10:50 AM in room 0302N of Hornbake Library. Online sessions will be asynchronous and expected to be completed before the Thursday sessions.', metadata={'source': '../data/semester-data.md'})]"
